			<h3>My goal with paramour is to design a way for adults to engage in sociodramatic play over the internet as a testing ground for romantic relationships. I based my design on the three following assumptions and solution. You can find a <a href="http://paramour.co">fake website pitching the idea here</a>. It's just a placeholder for the moment. More info on my process can be found at <a href="http://process.ryancan.build/post/110054288189/i-thought-id-like-to-go-over-the-process-of-how-i">this blog post</a>.</h3>

			<h3>This screen has by far the most information. On this screen, the user can view, submit, and rank prompts. This way, if the user's match is not responding quickly, they have something to do in the mean time. Also, since these suggestions come from other users, the experience improves as the user base grows. (Zoom in on the image if you want to read the copy; I spent a long time coming up with these prompts hehe).</h3>
