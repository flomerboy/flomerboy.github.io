	 			</div> 
			</div>
			<h3>The tools are placed in a way that they are ergonomically easier to press depending on how useful they are from a pedagogical standpoint. (i.e. the play button is the easiest to press at the beginning because it is good for students to listen before speaking or studying the grammar). I based this off of the standard model taught at Brown University (where I study Chinese):
			<ol>
				<li>listen 5 times</li>
				<li>read Aloud 5 times</li>
				<li>study Grammar/english meaning</li>
			</ol>
			<!-- This method encourages students to learn Chinese words and phrases in context of each other, instead of translating directly from english. <br />
			I am using a non-traditional navigation system that swipes open to reveal options, and animates slowly in its idle state. I chose this system for the following reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>Traditional nav systems are ergonomically painful</li>
				<li>I want to minimize the amount of information visually on the screen so the user can focus on the task at hand.</li>
				<li>I want to challenge conventions that exist just because of the tools we use (Sketch, templates, etc.)</li>
				<li>I want a product statement that isn't boring for the sake of looking "clean".</li>
				<li>Swiping the button the left goes "back" which gets rid of a whole button! That's a lot of screen real estate.</li>
			</ul>
			For the purposes of less visual stuff, I'm just showing the english version here. -->

			<h3>Although people are generally poor teachers of their own language, the best language learning happens when you can exchange with someone who is a native speaker. This is why "exchange" is a very important feature to 耳多／@ll ears. <br />When someone enters the "exchange" mode, they have the option to either submit a recording or provide feedback. The ergonomics/choice architecture is designed in such a way that users are encouraged to give personalized feedback. That is why the "record audio suggestion" button is closer to the home button than the "offer textual advice" button. When in the textual advise section, the shallow remarks are placed further away from the home position than the others.</h3>

			<h3>Another very important part of the feedback ecosystem of 耳多／@ll ears is the quality of feedback. I've designed the interface for viewing feedback in a way that it looks exciting and fun to receive feedback. The feedback hangs on the audio like fruit and pops up playfully as the audio goes by. If the feedback-giver records audio, the recording pauses and plays the feedback through before resuming. At the end, the recipient of feedback records whether or not they found the feedback useful. This statistic, combined the with the activity of users, combines to create a "helpful user" score, which sorts good users with new users, and other good users.</h3>

					<li>illustrations</li>
					<li>digitizing everything</li>

				More process coming very soon as I begin to test the functionality of the app with real- live students! Here is my plan for testing:
				<ol>
					<li>test efficiency of learning structure</li>
					<li>test "legibility" of icons</li>
					<li>test the feedback average Chinese speakers give to novice Chinese with an English accent; what is the most common feedback?</li>
					<li>test the feedback that average English speakers give to novice English speakers with a Chinese accent; what kind of feedback comes up all the time?</li>
					<li>stay open to unexpected things!</li>

Her pronunciation of 2nd and 4th tones was usually not dramatic enough, and the common phrases that she already knew were pronounced worst than the new words, conceivably because she has gotten used to saying them incorrecly over the years.

Like many other participants, he was able to get '江先生' perfectly when spoken one word at a time, but when it was strung together he tended to add an 'ng' sound to the end of 先, and get choked up on the vowel sounds.

			<h3>For this round of user testing, I put the dialogue screen on my computer, and instead of the user pressing buttons - I would just speak out loud and say what the app would say. I noticed very quickly that I needed to explain to people how to read pinyin (although I think I should test this again later) since some of the sounds in pinyin have no english equivalent (j and q are the hardest). Some other insights are that the pinyin should come underneath the characters - not replace them, and that when users record their own audio, the recording should play just before hand (except for advanced learners). There was a huge variability in learning speed, which I'm guessing is because of varied experience levels and to what extent the participants are "good with languages", this just means that I should make sure I have a high n value in future testing sessions.<br /><br />

			For my analysis, I'm calculating accuracy by dividing the number of 'wrong' words (words in which the tone, consonants, or vowel are mispronounced the the point that it is a different word), and dividing it by the # of total words (30), then subtracting that from 1.
